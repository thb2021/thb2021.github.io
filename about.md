# About Me

Hi! I'm Dennis Dangerfield. Due to an incident with a squirrel, I am legally
not allowed to post my picture online. However, I would love to tell you
about my work!

I am a videographer who records real people giving their authentic descriptions
of the hit TV series, The Office. I find that describing The Office really
releases the inner creativity of my subjects and allows them to imagine a world
different from our own.

My work is posted under the "Posts" tab. Please feel free to look around!

If you feel inspired and want to send me your own heartfelt descriptions of
The Office, please do! I love to see my work touching hearts and minds
around the world. My email is dennis.dangerfield@aolhotmail.com
