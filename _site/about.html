<p>Hi! I’m Dennis Dangerfield. Due to an incident with a squirrel, I am legally
not allowed to post my picture online. However, I would love to tell you
about my work!</p>

<p>I am a videographer who records real people giving their authentic descriptions
of the hit TV series, The Office. I find that describing The Office really
releases the inner creativity of my subjects and allows them to imagine a world
different from our own.</p>

<p>My work is posted under the “Posts” tab. Please feel free to look around!</p>

<p>If you feel inspired and want to send me your own heartfelt descriptions of
The Office, please do! I love to see my work touching hearts and minds
around the world. My email is dennis.dangerfield@aolhotmail.com</p>
