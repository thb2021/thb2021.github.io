**Usage:**
To view this blog locally, make sure to have Jekyll installed. Once you have downloaded Jekyll and the folder for this project, you can navigate to the directory of the project in the command line and type:

`jekyll serve`

This should allow you to see the blog at localhost:4000 in your browser

**Design Decisions:**

Since Dennis's blog is about The Office, I tried to make it match by having black text on a white background. The header font is Impact, the same as used in The Office's logo. The body font is Tahoma, another font used in the logo.

The navbar is also meant to follow a "The Office" aesthetic, although I did make the active link red to show viewers what page they are on. I also made the links turn grey when hovered over to help distinguish which link the user is about to click and to make the navbar more satisfying.

In laying out the posts, I put the videos first to take advantage of Z-patterns. This had the added benefit of displaying videos in the "Latest Posts" list, allowing viewers to easily browse through videos.

If I had designed this site before taking HCI, I would have centered everything. However, since we learned about F-patterns, I aligned the text to the left.

The blue hyperlinks on the "Posts" page deviates from the general aesthetic of the blog, but I left them as is in order to distinguish the links from normal text. It would have been nice to find a more aesthetically pleasing way of representing those links, as I did with the navbar.

**Challenge**

Before this challenge, I had never heard of Jekyll or Static Sites. Utilizing the command line to download gems was still a little challenging, but getting easier since I have some experience with the command line now.

Having never heard of GitHub Pages, I learned the vocabulary and set one up. Creating the repository on GitHub from the command line was new. Atom makes things easier after that though.

The biggest challenge was getting more experience with html, markdown, and CSS. CSS in particular seemed daunting at first, but once I challenged myself to style the navbar, it turned out to be much more manageable than I had feared.
